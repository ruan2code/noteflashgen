# 🧠 Noteflashgen

Do you want to turn your notes into Flashcards and accelerate your learning process? Noteflashgen will help you by doing exactly this!

## About

This project is created for a coding challenge with the following objective to build a small web app that lets users write short notes and instantly turn them into study flashcards using an AI API.

- TypeScript in a modern frontend framework: Angular (preferred), React or Vue
- Fetching and parsing API responses
- Writing effective prompts for AI-generated output


## Approach

### 1. Initial planning and structure
First, I created an overview of the core features and sketched out the main structure. I identified the components and interfaces and defined the relationships between these components.

### 2. Breaking down into tasks
I then divided the three core features into smaller tasks and organized them in Notion, using a Kanban board as my project management tool.

### 3. Implementation of core features
After that, I implemented feature 1 as the first work block, followed by implementing feature 2 and 3 together.

### 4. Layout and styling
Finally, I used the remaining time to work on the layout and CSS.

## Assumptions I made due to the 2-hour time constraint
- Automated tests can be omitted for this prototype.
- UX/UI is not the main priority, as I assume implementing the core functionality is more important at this stage. Normally, I pay a lot of attention to user-centric design that encourages interaction.
- A simple “loading” indicator is sufficient for this small prototype, although I have additional ideas, such as a mascot animation during loading.
- A basic flashcard display is sufficient for this initial version.


## Tech Stack 
- Angular v20.3.10
- vite 
- TypeScript
- OpenAI API 


## How to run on Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
